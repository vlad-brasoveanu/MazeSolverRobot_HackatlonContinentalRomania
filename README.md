# Maze Solver Robot - Hackathon Continental Romania 2024
Together with my colleagues George Emil Bujgoi and Mario Arbășelu, I formed the RoboEmpire team in order to participate in the Continental Hackathon, where we proved our software and hardware skills, programming and assembling the Alphabot2-Ar robot, thus obtaining the place 3 in the Maze Solving competition.
